# Ads Click Through Rate Prediction

 ## Overview

The Click Through Rate (CTR) is the ratio of clicks to impressions and is an important KPI when determining the success of an ad. This Click Through Rate Prediction project analyzes the CTR to better determine the types of people most likely to click on an ad. A machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) is also built to predict whether a user will click on an ad based on the various metrics collected such as daily time spent on the site, age, income, daily internet usage, etc., and their relationships.
